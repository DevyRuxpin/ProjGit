Answer the following questions below:

- What is PostgreSQL?
    * PostgreSQL (often called "Postgres") is a powerful, open-source object-relational database management system
      
- What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?
    *Scope:
      SQL is a language
      PostgreSQL is a complete database system
    *Features:
      SQL provides basic database operations
      PostgreSQL adds many advanced features
    *Extensibility:
      SQL is standardized
      PostgreSQL allows custom extensions

- In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?
    * psql -U username -p port_nums -d database_name
    * \C (this is the command to connect)

- What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`?
    * WHERE is executed BEFORE the GROUP BY
      HAVING is executed AFTER the GROUP BY

- What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join?
    * An INNER JOIN returns only the matching records between two tables where the join condition is met, while OUTER JOINs (LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL) return all records from one or both tables       even when there's no match. The main difference is that INNER JOINs show only complete matches, while OUTER JOINs can show unmatched records with NULL values on the non-matching side.

- What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join?
    * A LEFT OUTER join returns all records from the left (first) table and only matching records from the right (second) table, with NULL values for non-matching right table records. A           RIGHT OUTER join does the opposite, returning all records from the right table and only matching records from the left table, with NULL values for non-matching left table records.

- What is an ORM? What do they do?
    * ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, a programming technique that lets developers interact with a database using their preferred programming language instead of writing raw SQL       queries, by converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages and relational databases

- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX 
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?
    * The main difference is that AJAX requests are made from the client's browser (frontend) and are subject to browser security restrictions like CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing),           while server-side requests using libraries like requests are made from your server (backend) and don't have these browser limitations. Another key difference is that server-side             requests can keep sensitive data like API keys secure, while client-side AJAX requests expose any credentials or tokens in the browser's code where users can see them.

- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?
    * CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a type of attack where a malicious website tricks a user's browser into making unintended requests to a trusted website where the user is                authenticated, potentially performing unauthorized actions like changing account details or making transactions. A CSRF token is a unique, random value generated by the server and           included in forms or AJAX requests to verify that the request is legitimate and originated from the authenticated user, preventing such attacks by ensuring the request wasn't forged.

- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?
    * The purpose is to render hidden fields in an HTML form, such as the CSRF token, which is automatically included for CSRF protection. This ensures that the hidden fields (like the CSRF       token) are properly included in the form submission, allowing the server to validate the request's authenticity.
