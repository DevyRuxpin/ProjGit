Over the past decade, I've specialized in open source intelligence gathering, 
threat assessment, and undercover work focused on neo-Nazi and white 
nationalist organizations. This involved advanced digital interaction and 
social engineering techniques, including infiltrating leadership at significant
events. Working in such high-demand, high-stress environments sharpened my 
analytical, problem-solving, and technical skills. Now, I’m pivoting to Software 
Engineering and am currently enrolled in Springboard’s web development program. 
I'm excited to leverage my expertise in digital interactions and intelligence 
analysis to create secure and efficient web solutions.
